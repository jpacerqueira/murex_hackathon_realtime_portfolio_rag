subscribe to trade-views, to receive updates matching filtering criteria
The API can be used to serve named MX user use cases or Client Servicing use cases.

API Deployment & Configuration


MX User Trade Views
Retrieve list of trades matching filtering criteria.

Given a list of trades in MX, several sets of fields can be retrieved. This perspective on a list of trades is a trade-view. The trades returned in a trade-view can be filtered on the fields available in the trade-view, or on additional trade properties independent from the trade-view definition.

Get Views

A trade-view returns a list of trades as a table, with a list of properties (fields). The available fields for a given trade-view are defined through server-side configuration.

Each trade-view can return a different set of fields. The definition of the returned fields (name, type) is part of the response.

How to define the set of fields returned by a trade-view:

query Parameters
includeSchema	
boolean
Default: true
Set to false to only return the data, without the schema (column description)

tradeViewSpecificParams	
object
Example: ContractTypology=Spot&insertionDate=2022-05-11
Each field from the trade-view can be filtered on, unless specified otherwise in the field description.

The name tradeViewSpecificParams is not part of the API contract, is it a logical name to group in the documentation those parameters whose name is configuration-dependent.

It is only possible to filter on fields available in the view.

For each parameter, several values can be passed (each query parameter on a field name is an array of the field's type). The returned results contain entries having at least one of the values from the query parameter, e.g.:

?counterparty=BANK A&counterparty=BANK B returns all deals having counterparty BANK A or counterparty BANK B
filtering on different parameters (e.g. status and counterparty) will return deals matching at least one value from each parameter, e.g.:

?counterparty=BANK A&status=Ins returns all deals having counterparty BANK A and status Ins
?counterparty=BANK A&counterparty=BANK B&status=Ins returns all deals having (counterparty BANK A or BANK B) and (status Ins)
Below are commonly used fields and the corresponding entry in MX blotter dictionary - where to find them when creating the view as a configurator.

Field (final name is user defined)	Blotter dictionary entry under GENERIC_VIEW	Comment
counterparties	Counterpart	
portfolios	Portfolio	
status	InternalStatus	ins, mod, cancl
inserter	User	
Deal status	LiveStatus	Possible values: LIVE, MKT_OP, DEAD
insertiondate	SystemDate	This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
actualdate	EffectiveTradeDate	This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
modificationdate	ModificationDateTime	Time of the latest event on the deal. This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
instrument	Instrument	
typology	Typology	
lastevent	LastEventClass >> Event Type	Possible values: Amend, early take up, etc.
lastevendate	LastEventDate	
internalDealPerspective	
string
Enum: "INITIATOR" "BENEFICIARY"
Example: internalDealPerspective=INITIATOR
"Internal Deals" are trades booked from portfolio to portfolio. They are represented as two identical rows except for the "Counterparty" and "Portfolio", which are inverted. Internal Deals can be identified by an "Internal" column.

internalDealPerspective allows returning a single row (a single perspective) for those internal deals:

that of the initiator (INITIATOR). Those are the deals which are returned in the trade blotter screen without filtering.
that of the beneficiary (BENEFICIARY). From the trade blotter screen in MX, this can be
It does not impact the visibility of non-internal deals.

If unset, the two perspective are returned (two almost identical rows per internal deal)

Search criteria

internalDealPerspective	
string or null
Enum: "INITIATOR" "BENEFICIARY"
"Internal Deals" are trades booked from portfolio to portfolio. They are represented as two identical rows except for the "Counterparty" and "Portfolio", which are inverted. Internal Deals can be identified by an "Internal" column.

internalDealPerspective allows returning a single row (a single perspective) for those internal deals:

that of the initiator (INITIATOR). Those are the deals which are returned in the trade blotter screen without filtering.
that of the beneficiary (BENEFICIARY). From the trade blotter screen in MX, this can be retrieved by filtering on the target portfolio (this is the only way to see this row in the trade blotter MX screen).
It does not impact the visibility of non-internal deals.

If unset, the two perspective are returned (two almost identical rows per internal deal)

insertedOrModifiedBySelf	
boolean
Default: true
Only returns deals insert or modified by currently authenticated user.

"insertedOrModifiedBySelf": true is equivalent to (GENERIC_VIEW.User OR GENERIC_VIEW.LastEventUser) == <current_user>

bookedOrAmendedDate	
Array of objects (bookedOrAmendedDate)
bookedOrAmendedDate filters on (GENERIC_VIEW.TradeDate OR GENERIC_VIEW.LastEventDate). The same filters as for the columnValues are available
to support a date range, have 2 elements in the array, with “le/lt/ge/gt” as operator, instead of “in”
there is no consistency check: all criteria from the array are applied even if mutually excluding. If nothing is return, the search criteria need to be adjusted
"in": ["a"] is equivalent to "eq": "a"
examples of filter for various needs:
{"bookedOrAmendedDate": [{"in": ["TODAY"]}]}: filters out trade insertion as of past date so there cannot be past PL impact here.
{ "bookedOrAmendedDate": [{"in": ["TODAY"]}], columnValues:[{"field": "EffectiveTradeDate", "eq": "TODAY"}]} to exclude late trading ( late trading date = Today +1OD)
{ "bookedOrAmendedDate": [{"in": ["2021-10-10"]}], columnValues:[{"field": "EffectiveTradeDate", "eq": "TODAY"}]} to spot past corrections that contribute to the PL only today
{"columnValues":[{"field": "InsertionDate", "eq": "TODAY"}]} to return all trades technically inserted today (regardless of the trade date and effective trade date), even those who may impact past PL.
{"columnValues":[{"field": "InsertionDate", "eq": "TODAY"}, {"field": "EffectiveTradeDate", "eq": "TODAY"}]} to return all trades technically inserted today (regardless of the trade date and effective trade date), excluding those impacting past PL.
columnValues	
Array of objects (columnValues) [ items = 2 items ]
List of filtering criteria per column:

several filters can be applied on the same column
the API looks for the results where all criteria match (intersection / AND clause)
if a field from the view is of type "date", then TODAY can be used as a valid value ; api interprets it as the logged in users FO Desk Date
for "in", "nin", the elements of operator array can accept null only for date field
for "eq", "neq", the operator can accept null only for date field
for "le", "lt", "ge", "gt", the operator cannot accept null

Client Trade Views
Retrieve list of trades matching filtering criteria, enforcing filtering by counterparty: to limit the risk of leaking client data in client servicing use cases, when interacting with the API through a "technical"/service account user.

Given a list of trades in MX, several sets of fields can be retrieved. This perspective on a list of trades is a trade-view. The trades returned in a trade-view can be filtered on the fields available in the trade-view, or on additional trade properties independent from the trade-view definition.

/client-trade-views/{viewId}



A trade-view returns a list of trades as a table, with a list of properties (fields). The available fields for a given trade-view are defined through server-side configuration. Each trade-view can return a different set of fields. The definition of the returned fields (name, type) is part of the response.

How to define the set of fields returned by a trade-view:

Refer to MX official docs
has-authority: api.trade-blotter.client-trade-views::read
Authorizations:
BearerAuth
path Parameters
viewId
required
string
Target View

query Parameters
counterparties
required
Array of strings
Example: counterparties=COUNTERPARTY A&counterparties=COUNTERPARTY B
Only retrieve trades whose counterparty is part of the input list. Possible values for the "counterparty" field are listed in the MX group chinese wall template.

Only views having a field name "counterparties" mapped to field GENERIC_VIEW.Counterpart from MX blotter dictionary can be used.

In case the client-trade-views endpoint is used with a view which does not contain the field properly mapped, an error will be thrown. At configuration time, the availability of this field can be enforced.

includeSchema	
boolean
Default: true
Set to false to only return the data, without the schema (column description)

tradeViewSpecificParams	
object
Example: ContractTypology=Spot&insertionDate=2022-05-11
Each field from the trade-view can be filtered on, unless specified otherwise in the field description.

The name tradeViewSpecificParams is not part of the API contract, is it a logical name to group in the documentation those parameters whose name is configuration-dependent.

It is only possible to filter on fields available in the view.

For each parameter, several values can be passed (each query parameter on a field name is an array of the field's type). The returned results contain entries having at least one of the values from the query parameter, e.g.:

?counterparty=BANK A&counterparty=BANK B returns all deals having counterparty BANK A or counterparty BANK B
filtering on different parameters (e.g. status and counterparty) will return deals matching at least one value from each parameter, e.g.:

?counterparty=BANK A&status=Ins returns all deals having counterparty BANK A and status Ins
?counterparty=BANK A&counterparty=BANK B&status=Ins returns all deals having (counterparty BANK A or BANK B) and (status Ins)
Below are commonly used fields and the corresponding entry in MX blotter dictionary - where to find them when creating the view as a configurator.

Field (final name is user defined)	Blotter dictionary entry under GENERIC_VIEW	Comment
counterparties	Counterpart	
portfolios	Portfolio	
status	InternalStatus	ins, mod, cancl
inserter	User	
Deal status	LiveStatus	Possible values: LIVE, MKT_OP, DEAD
insertiondate	SystemDate	This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
actualdate	EffectiveTradeDate	This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
modificationdate	ModificationDateTime	Time of the latest event on the deal. This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
instrument	Instrument	
typology	Typology	
lastevent	LastEventClass >> Event Type	Possible values: Amend, early take up, etc.
lastevendate	LastEventDate

Browse Snapshot

get
/client-trade-views/{viewId}/snapshots/{snapshotId}



When data from a view contains more than the maximum number of rows supported by the server, then a snapshot of the searched data is taken.

The dataset can be browse through this endpoint.

It is short lived: the snapshot will be purged after a certain Time To Live (TTL).

has-authority: api.trade-blotter.client-trade-views::read
Authorizations:
BearerAuth
path Parameters
viewId
required
string
Target View

snapshotId
required
string
Id of the snapshot for this data query. If set, any filtering parameters are ignored

query Parameters
includeSchema	
boolean
Default: true
Set to false to only return the data, without the schema (column description)

tradeViewSpecificParams	
object
Example: ContractTypology=Spot&insertionDate=2022-05-11
Each field from the trade-view can be filtered on, unless specified otherwise in the field description.

The name tradeViewSpecificParams is not part of the API contract, is it a logical name to group in the documentation those parameters whose name is configuration-dependent.

It is only possible to filter on fields available in the view.

For each parameter, several values can be passed (each query parameter on a field name is an array of the field's type). The returned results contain entries having at least one of the values from the query parameter, e.g.:

?counterparty=BANK A&counterparty=BANK B returns all deals having counterparty BANK A or counterparty BANK B
filtering on different parameters (e.g. status and counterparty) will return deals matching at least one value from each parameter, e.g.:

?counterparty=BANK A&status=Ins returns all deals having counterparty BANK A and status Ins
?counterparty=BANK A&counterparty=BANK B&status=Ins returns all deals having (counterparty BANK A or BANK B) and (status Ins)
Below are commonly used fields and the corresponding entry in MX blotter dictionary - where to find them when creating the view as a configurator.

Field (final name is user defined)	Blotter dictionary entry under GENERIC_VIEW	Comment
counterparties	Counterpart	
portfolios	Portfolio	
status	InternalStatus	ins, mod, cancl
inserter	User	
Deal status	LiveStatus	Possible values: LIVE, MKT_OP, DEAD
insertiondate	SystemDate	This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
actualdate	EffectiveTradeDate	This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
modificationdate	ModificationDateTime	Time of the latest event on the deal. This field of type date (format iso8601) also access TODAY as a valid value. TODAY is a keyword resolved MX side as the FO Desk Date of the current user, deduced from the FO Desk or Group used at login time.
instrument	Instrument	
typology	Typology	
lastevent	LastEventClass >> Event Type	Possible values: Amend, early take up, etc.
lastevendate	LastEventDate	
offset	
integer >= 0
Default: 0
Used for pagination.

results are sent by chunks of limit entries.
if more than limit entries are available, then several requests will be needed to get all results.
given default limit size of 1000, page 1, 2..n are obtained by having offset = 0, 1000, 2000, etc. (i.e. for each page, offset == (page number - 1) * limit)
if offset > total number of results: 400 Error
limit	
integer [ 1 .. 10000 ]
Default: 10000
Max number of results which will be returned.

Get the description of a given view :

field: containing all fields of the view (breakdowns and outputs)
primaryKey: ids of the breakdowns in the view.
Hidden outputs and hidden breakdowns are not included in the details of the view.

Search criteria

counterparties	
Array of strings non-empty
Non-empty list of counterparts

in case of clients perspective the developer is expected to perform externally the mapping
in case of sales we expect a native way to declare the scope of visibility (authorization) and this will be leveraged seamlessly
bookedOrAmendedDate	
Array of objects (bookedOrAmendedDate)
bookedOrAmendedDate filters on (GENERIC_VIEW.TradeDate OR GENERIC_VIEW.LastEventDate). The same filters as for the columnValues are available
to support a date range, have 2 elements in the array, with “le/lt/ge/gt” as operator, instead of “in”
there is no consistency check: all criteria from the array are applied even if mutually excluding. If nothing is return, the search criteria need to be adjusted
"in": ["a"] is equivalent to "eq": "a"
examples of filter for various needs:
{"bookedOrAmendedDate": [{"in": ["TODAY"]}]}: filters out trade insertion as of past date so there cannot be past PL impact here.
{ "bookedOrAmendedDate": [{"in": ["TODAY"]}], columnValues:[{"field": "EffectiveTradeDate", "eq": "TODAY"}]} to exclude late trading ( late trading date = Today +1OD)
{ "bookedOrAmendedDate": [{"in": ["2021-10-10"]}], columnValues:[{"field": "EffectiveTradeDate", "eq": "TODAY"}]} to spot past corrections that contribute to the PL only today
{"columnValues":[{"field": "InsertionDate", "eq": "TODAY"}]} to return all trades technically inserted today (regardless of the trade date and effective trade date), even those who may impact past PL.
{"columnValues":[{"field": "InsertionDate", "eq": "TODAY"}, {"field": "EffectiveTradeDate", "eq": "TODAY"}]} to return all trades technically inserted today (regardless of the trade date and effective trade date), excluding those impacting past PL.
columnValues	
Array of objects (columnValues) [ items = 2 items ]
List of filtering criteria per column:

several filters can be applied on the same column
the API looks for the results where all criteria match (intersection / AND clause)
if a field from the view is of type "date", then TODAY can be used as a valid value ; api interprets it as the logged in users FO Desk Date
for "in", "nin", the elements of operator array can accept null only for date field
for "eq", "neq", the operator can accept null only for date field
for "le", "lt", "ge", "gt", the operator cannot accept null
